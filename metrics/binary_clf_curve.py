def _binary_clf_curve(y_true, y_score):
    """
    Calculate true and false positives per binary classification
    threshold (can be used for roc curve or precision/recall curve);
    the calcuation makes the assumption that the positive case
    will always be labeled as 1

    Parameters
    ----------
    y_true : 1d ndarray, shape = [n_samples]
        True targets/labels of binary classification

    y_score : 1d ndarray, shape = [n_samples]
        Estimated probabilities or scores

    Returns
    -------
    tps : 1d ndarray
        True positives counts, index i records the number
        of positive samples that got assigned a
        score >= thresholds[i].
        The total number of positive samples is equal to
        tps[-1] (thus false negatives are given by tps[-1] - tps)

    fps : 1d ndarray
        False positives counts, index i records the number
        of negative samples that got assigned a
        score >= thresholds[i].
        The total number of negative samples is equal to
        fps[-1] (thus true negatives are given by fps[-1] - fps)

    thresholds : 1d ndarray
        Predicted score sorted in decreasing order
